# What is Javascript?

There are three main components that make up a website.
Web browsers display pages using _HTML_. These pages can be styled and the layout can be adjusted using _CSS_, but if we want our users to have a rich, responsive, interactive experience when using our website, we need a programming language. That’s where _Javascript_ comes in.

Javascript or _JS_ is one of the most widely used programming languages in the world, mostly because it’s used by nearly every website, but these days it is also used for a wide variety of applications outside of web browsers, often using Node.js.

Your journey to building great websites will start using Node.js. You need to learn the basics of programming before you move on to working in the browser.

## A brief history

In 1995, websites were static, meaning they didn't have any interactivity. You couldn't hide or show things dynamically, submit forms seamlessly or any of the interesting things we can do in modern web browsers.

Netscape's Navigator was the most popular browser and Java was one of the most popular programming languages. Netscape decided to invent a new language to be used in Navigator and they wanted the syntax to be familiar to Java developers. So much so, that they called their new language Javascript. JS has nothing to do with Java, it was only a marketing ploy!

JS has remained in use in web browsers ever since 1995, which is one reason why you'll often find _so many_ different ways to do the same thing. All of the websites built over the last 25 years need to be supported, so whenever a new version of JS is released, all of the old functionality remains.

One last thing to note is that Javascript is not really called Javascript. It's officially an implementation of the ECMAScript standard. A large number of new features were introduced in ECMAScript version 6, released in 2015. For this reason, you may see modern Javascript referred to as ES6, or _very_ modern JS being referred to as ES.Next.
